        <img src="https://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/life-is-strange/images/e/e5/09_1920.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160204125046" class="headline-image" >
        <p class="news-explanation">Professor and Photographer Mark Jefferson, was arrested today near Blackwell Academy. HeÂ´s the primary suspect of the dissapering of Rachel Amber and other four girls, all students of the Blackwell Academy.</p>
        <p class="news-explanation">Mark Jefferson is a calm, mild-mannered and charismatic man, but can be pretentious, wrathful and capable of killing someone in cold blood, even if the victims are only teenage girls. He tries to inspire his students as he claims his photos are works of art and is almost always quoting famous people, as he's concerned about the talent and photos of Max, although he didn't show any remorse at the moment of drugging, abusing and hurting her. He mainly specializes in dark photos of sexualized young women and domination, replicating his work through his photography of the young women he kidnaps.
                
                As for his tastes, Mark Jefferson is a cultivated man and an expert at the 1990's photography style; in fact, in the Blackwell's school pamphlet, there is an entire page dedicated to him. Max Caulfield says on one occasion that he is very neat, tidy and even faddish, as is seen in Chapter Five, when Max kicks the table and wets the photos with anesthetics. Jefferson also despises the "selfies", seeing them as a waste of time and talent.
                
                In episode five, he mentions that he and Rachel Amber had a connection, but Nathan Prescott gave her an overdose. That fact was never demonstrated due to the fact that a word of a narcissistic psychopath should never be trusted.
                
                Mark Jefferson was indeed a psychopath, showing traits such as: narcissism, apathy, talent at manipulation and charming.</p>
