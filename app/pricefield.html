        <h1 class="arcadia-bay-news__topic">Hella Cool!</h1>
        <p class="news-explanation">This article is meant to be a deeper and more detailed look at the relationship between Max Caulfield and Chloe Price, also known as Pricefield, and its development throughout the Life is Strange franchise. Max and Chloe are childhood friends who fell out of touch after Max moved with her parents to Seattle and rekindle their friendship during the events of the original game. They are long-time friends, regardless of Max's choices.</p>
        <p class="news-explanation">Max and Chloe have been friends since childhood. Max used to spend time at Chloe's house, where the two would often play pirates by dressing up and pretending the living room couch is a pirate ship. Chloe's father, William Price, would occasionally entertain them by hosting barbecues in the backyard and kept a height chart in Chloe's room. The two also enjoyed watching TV shows, such as Spongebob, Power Rangers, Blue's Clues and Teletubbies, and they had movie nights and played video games together. They had a tree fort, the location of which Chloe marked on the map of Arcadia Bay at the lighthouse so they would "always be able to find each other in case of emergency."
                In 1999, Chloe's parents bought her a kitten named Bongo, which would later become part of Max and Chloe's "superhero adventure" drawings. After he got killed by a car, Chloe and Max made a gravestone for him located in Chloe's backyard. Also in the backyard of Chloe's house, there is a swing which Max and Chloe would take turns on when they were little. Chloe liked to fly way up into the air, while Max was scared and always jumped off before falling. There is also a wooden board decorated by the two girls, although the drawing is now barely visible. 
                
                In 2008, the girls were having secret "wine tasting sessions" at Chloe's house, one of which is remembered by Max when she visits Chloe's house for the first time in five years. The wine spilt on the carpet in the dining room had left a stain which couldn't be washed out and remains visible to the present day. (It is likely that this stain was what gave their wine tasting activities away to Chloe's parents.)
                
                At some point in 2008, Max and Chloe were making pancakes together with William at Chloe's house when Chloe's mom called and asked William to pick her up from the grocery store, which led to William's death in a car accident. Although Max was supportive at the time, she soon moved to Seattle with her parents, leaving her best friend and her old life behind. The two fell out of touch until Max's return to Arcadia Bay five years later. </p>
