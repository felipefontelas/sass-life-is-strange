        <h1 class="arcadia-bay-news__topic">Victoria Chase</h1>
        <i><p class="news-explanation">"I always feel like I have to overcompensate. For what, I have no clue. I'm only here to become a photographer, not president."</p></i>
        <p class="news-explanation">â€” Victoria Chase to Max Caulfield in "Dark Room"</p>
        <p class="news-explanation">
                Victoria Maribeth Chase (born August 14th, 1995) is a student at Blackwell Academy. She is best friends with Nathan Prescott, Taylor Christensen, and Courtney Wagner. She serves as the tertiary antagonist in Life is Strange: Season 1.
                
                Victoria reappears in Before the Storm, the prequel to the events of Life is Strange.

        <p class="news-explanation">
                Rich and arrogant, Victoria is a typical snob who boasts about her expensive designer clothing and state-of-the-art electronic equipment for her classes. Max Caulfield frequently feels jealous regarding her possessions. Victoria gossips and seems the stereotypical bitchy queen-bee figure at Blackwell. She picks on Max and other students and is known to be quite dramatic. Hayden Jones comments that she is funny when intoxicated. We then find out that she only picks on Max out of envy and due to her image at Blackwell--even though she would like to hang out with Max, Victoria is unable to.
                
                We discover that Victoria has a secret nerdy side, evident from the collectible figurine Max finds in her bedroom in "Chaos Theory". She also seems to be quite studious due to her high GPA and her knowledgeable responses in Mark Jefferson's class. She is ambitious as she had inquired about having her pictures displayed in the Kroft Gallery; she was unfortunately rejected.
                
                Contrary to the initial impression, Victoria has a vulnerable side; she confides in Max that she overcompensates despite her talent and supposed confidence. It seems as though there is more to her than meets the eye, and that she is secretly just hopeful for a future career in photography and wants what any other teenager wants: to fit in.
                
                Victoria seems to have great admiration for Jefferson, displaying his artwork in her room and attempting to flirt with him so her work gets out. She also presumably attends an event at the Bean Hip Cafe, evident from the flyer in her room about Jefferson's show there.
        </p>  
        <p class="news-explanation">
                Victoria comes from a very wealthy background, similar to Nathan Prescott. Her parents own the "Chase Space", a famous gallery in her hometown Seattle that Max is impressed by. Just like most of the other students, she came to Blackwell due to her admiration of photography teacher Mark Jefferson. In 2009, she attended one of Jefferson's exhibitions at the Bean Hip Cafe, and she even bought a book featuring his photography work. She feels distinctly pressured by her parents and their careers; she comments on how aware she is about the struggles of the cut-throat photography business. Aspiring to join the fashion industry as a photographer in later life, she submitted her portfolio to galleries such as the Kroft Gallery but got rejected.
