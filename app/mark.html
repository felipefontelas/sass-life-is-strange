        <i><p class="news-explanation">"Seriously, though, I could frame any one of you in a dark corner,
                and capture you in a moment of desperation."</p></i>
        <p class="news-explanation">â€” Mark Jefferson in "Chrysalis"</p>
        <p class="news-explanation">
                Mark Jefferson (born April 11, 1975) is a photography teacher at Blackwell Academy and the main antagonist of Life is Strange. As a famous photographer and a widely recognized artist across America, he gained popularity during the '90s. Introduced as the cool and nice teacher who is greatly admired by his students, including Max Caulfield, he is later revealed to be the true main antagonist in Life is Strange. Throughout the game, Jefferson was either directly or indirectly responsible for the (potential) deaths of a total of seven characters.

        <p class="news-explanation">
                Jefferson is the archetype of a psychopath.[2]
                
                Outwardly Jefferson appears to be a charismatic and charming man, an active and passionate photographer and teacher. He seems to care about the work of his students, making sure all of his students enter the "Everyday Heroes" Contest with a gentle reminder at the end of his photography class session in order to have a chance at progressing their artistic careers. However, his dismissive treatment of Kate's problems as she asks for help in "Out of Time", already portrays him as somewhat callous and insensitive at that point.
                
                Jefferson seems to be cautious around the flirtatious nature of his student Victoria Chase. Despite her efforts to flirt with him, he declines; especially as she becomes more explicit in "Chaos Theory". This could be because of the value he places on innocence.
                
                In reality, Jefferson is a cold individual who cares very little for others, with an obscure obsession to capture the frame of "innocence" in others. He is obsessed with the idea of "capturing that moment innocence evolves into corruption", and is prepared to kill anyone who he deems a liability to him or his plans, stopping at nothing to achieve his personal objectives. He is willing to manipulate others to his advantage while making sure that they remain silent. Jefferson seems to have situations planned out well in advance, this combined with his high intelligence and extreme cunning has allowed him to continue what he is doing without being caught.

        <p class="news-explanation">

His hair is a choppy messy style, and he has a light trendy beard. His attire is smart casual; he wears black loafers, blue jeans and a white button up shirt with a black blazer over it. He also wears black and white trendy glasses.
